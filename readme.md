## Bloom

Bloom is a fork of Folia that has no ambition to be widely used by the public.

## Warning

Each patch will be deactivatable if you wish to use Bloom. Bloom will not be stable, and I don't think it ever will be. Nevertheless, it is "usable," but I do not guarantee its functioning on production servers.
